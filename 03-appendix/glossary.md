# Glossary

## Terms and Definitions

### API Proxy
A proxy that sits between clients and backend services, providing API management capabilities such as security, transformation, and monitoring.

### Policy
A rule that can be applied to requests, responses, or errors to control behavior, security, transformation, and more.

### Pipeline
The execution flow for policies. There are three pipelines:
- **Request Pipeline**: Executes before forwarding request to backend
- **Response Pipeline**: Executes after receiving response from backend
- **Error Pipeline**: Executes when an error occurs

### Environment
A deployment target where API proxies can be deployed (e.g., production, staging, development).

### Connection
A configuration for connecting to external systems (e.g., databases, message queues, email servers).

### Credential
Authentication information used to access protected resources.

### Certificate
A digital certificate used for SSL/TLS encryption and authentication.

### Deployment
The process of publishing API proxy configurations to an environment.

### Rate Limiting
Controlling the number of requests that can be made within a specified time period.

### Throttling
Limiting the rate of requests to prevent overload.

### Quota
A limit on the total number of requests allowed over a period of time.

### Variable
A reference to data that can be extracted from requests, responses, or context. See [Variable Definition](variable-definition/) for complete documentation.

### Policy Condition
A condition that determines when a policy should be executed.

### Endpoint
A specific path and HTTP method combination in an API proxy.

### Project
A container for API proxies, policies, connections, and other resources.

### RLCL
Rate Limit Control List - A list that defines rate limiting rules for specific credentials or endpoints.

### GeoLocation
Geographic location settings for API proxies.

### mTLS
Mutual TLS - A security protocol where both client and server authenticate each other using certificates.

### OAuth2
An authorization framework for API access.

### OIDC
OpenID Connect - An authentication layer built on top of OAuth2.

### JWT
JSON Web Token - A compact token format for securely transmitting information.

### WS-Security
Web Services Security - Standards for securing SOAP web services.

### SAML
Security Assertion Markup Language - An XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data.

### JOSE
JSON Object Signing and Encryption - Standards for signing and encrypting JSON data.

### Enum
An enumeration - a fixed set of named values used in API requests and responses. See [Enum Reference](enum-reference/) for complete list.

### Status
Response status indicating success or failure of an operation. Values: `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`.

### Pipeline
The execution flow for policies. There are three pipelines: REQUEST, RESPONSE, and ERROR.

### Scope
The range where a policy applies. Values: `ALL` (all endpoints) or `ENDPOINT` (specific endpoint).

### HTTP Method
The HTTP verb used in API requests. Common values: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, `ALL`.

### API Type
The type of API Proxy. Values: `REST`, `SOAP`, `GRPC`, `WEBSOCKET`.
