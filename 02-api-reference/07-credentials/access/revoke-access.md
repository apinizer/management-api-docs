# Revoke Access

## Overview

Revokes access from a credential for one or more API Proxies or API Proxy Groups. The credential will no longer be able to access the specified resources. Access revocation is automatically deployed to all environments.

## Endpoint

```
DELETE /apiops/projects/{projectName}/credentials/{username}/access/
```

## Authentication

Requires a Personal API Access Token.

**Header:**
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Request

### Headers

| Header | Value | Required |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token} | Yes |
| Content-Type | application/json | Yes |

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| projectName | string | Yes | Project name |
| username | string | Yes | Username of the credential |

### Request Body

Same structure as Grant Access. Object containing an array of access objects.

#### Full JSON Body Example - Revoke Access from Single API Proxy

```json
{
  "credentialAccessList": [
    {
      "name": "MyAPI",
      "type": "API_PROXY"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Full JSON Body Example - Revoke Access from Multiple Resources

```json
{
  "credentialAccessList": [
    {
      "name": "MyAPI",
      "type": "API_PROXY"
    },
    {
      "name": "PaymentAPI",
      "type": "API_PROXY"
    },
    {
      "name": "MyAPIGroup",
      "type": "API_PROXY_GROUP"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Request Body Fields

Same as Grant Access. See [Grant Access](./grant-access.md#request-body-fields) for field descriptions.

**Notes:**
- Request body must be an object with `credentialAccessList` array
- Each access object must have `name` and `type`
- `name` must match an existing API Proxy or API Proxy Group
- `type` must be either `API_PROXY` or `API_PROXY_GROUP`
- Access must exist to be revoked
- Revocation is automatically deployed to all environments

### Response

#### Success Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "deploymentResult": {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Undeployment completed successfully",
    "environmentResults": [
      {
        "environmentName": "production",
        "success": true,
        "message": "Undeployed successfully"
      },
      {
        "environmentName": "staging",
        "success": true,
        "message": "Undeployed successfully"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Error Response (400 Bad Request)

```json
{
  "error": "bad_request",
  "error_description": "Credential access object name can not be empty!"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "error": "bad_request",
  "error_description": "API Proxy (name:MyAPI) is not found or user does not have privilege to access it!"
}
```

**Common Causes:**
- Empty access object
- Missing `name` or `type` field
- API Proxy or API Proxy Group does not exist
- Access does not exist (already revoked)

## cURL Example

### Example 1: Revoke Access from Single API Proxy

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/credentials/api-user/access/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "credentialAccessList": [
      {
        "name": "MyAPI",
        "type": "API_PROXY"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Example 2: Revoke Access from Multiple Resources

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/credentials/api-user/access/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "credentialAccessList": [
      {
        "name": "MyAPI",
        "type": "API_PROXY"
      },
      {
        "name": "MyAPIGroup",
        "type": "API_PROXY_GROUP"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Notes and Warnings

- **Request Body Format**: 
  - Request body must be an object with `credentialAccessList` array
  - Even for single revocation, use object format with array inside
- **Access Must Exist**: 
  - Access must exist to be revoked
  - Revoking non-existent access will fail silently
- **Automatic Undeployment**: 
  - Access revocation is automatically undeployed from all environments
  - Undeployment results are returned in the response
- **API Proxy Group**: 
  - Revoking access from API Proxy Group revokes access to all APIs in the group
  - Individual API accesses are not affected if group access is revoked
- **Permissions**: 
  - Requires `ROLE_MANAGE_PROXIES` permission
  - Requires `ROLE_DEPLOY_UNDEPLOY_PROXIES` permission for undeployment
  - User must have access to the project and resources
