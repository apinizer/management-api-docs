# Environments API

## Overview

The Environments API provides endpoints for managing deployment environments in Apinizer. Environments are deployment targets where API proxies can be deployed (e.g., production, staging, development).

## Endpoints

- [List Environments](./list-environments) - Get all environments (admin only)
- [Get Environments by Project](./get-environments-by-project) - Get environments accessible from a project

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication using a Personal API Access Token.

## Permissions

- **List All Environments**: Requires admin role
- **Get Environments by Project**: Requires project membership
