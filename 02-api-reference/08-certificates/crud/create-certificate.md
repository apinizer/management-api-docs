```

## Authentication

Requires a Personal API Access Token.

### Header

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Request

### Headers

| Header | Value | Required |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token} | Yes |
| Content-Type | multipart/form-data | Yes |

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| projectName | string | Yes | Project name |

### Form Data

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| certificateName | string | Yes | Certificate name (unique identifier) |
| alias | string | Yes | Certificate alias (unique per environment) |
| certificateDescription | string | Yes | Certificate description |
| environmentList | array[string] | Yes | Comma-separated list of environment names to deploy to |
| pemEncodedFile | file | Yes | PEM-encoded certificate file |

### Notes

- `certificateName` must be unique within the project
- `alias` must be unique per environment (can be same across environments)
- `environmentList` is comma-separated (e.g., "production,staging")
- `pemEncodedFile` must be a valid PEM-encoded certificate file
- Certificate file must not be empty
- Certificate is automatically deployed to all specified environments

### PEM File Format

The certificate file should be in PEM format:

```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIFXTCCBEWgAwIBAgIQ...
(base64 encoded certificate content)
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### Response

#### Success Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "deploymentResult": {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Deployment completed successfully",
    "environmentResults": [
      {
        "environmentName": "production",
        "success": true,
        "message": "Deployed successfully"
      },
      {
        "environmentName": "staging",
        "success": true,
        "message": "Deployed successfully"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Error Response (400 Bad Request)

```json
{
  "error": "bad_request",
  "error_description": "certificateName value can not be empty!"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "error": "bad_request",
  "error_description": "alias value can not be empty!"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "error": "bad_request",
  "error_description": "pemEncodedFile value can not be empty!"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "error": "bad_request",
  "error_description": "environmentList value can not be empty!"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "error": "bad_request",
  "error_description": "Certificate (name: my-certificate) is already exist!"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "error": "bad_request",
  "error_description": "Alias (my-cert-alias) is already used for another certificate, try changing this value!"
}
```

### Common Causes

- Missing required form fields
- Certificate name already exists
- Alias already exists in the environment
- Invalid PEM file format
- Empty certificate file
- Environment does not exist

## cURL Example

### Example 1: Create Certificate with Single Environment

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/certificates/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "certificateName=my-certificate" \
  -F "alias=my-cert-alias" \
  -F "certificateDescription=SSL certificate for API" \
  -F "environmentList=production" \
  -F "pemEncodedFile=@certificate.pem"
```

### Example 2: Create Certificate with Multiple Environments

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/certificates/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "certificateName=my-certificate" \
  -F "alias=my-cert-alias" \
  -F "certificateDescription=SSL certificate for API" \
  -F "environmentList=production,staging,development" \
  -F "pemEncodedFile=@certificate.pem"
```

## Notes and Warnings

- **Certificate Name**: 
  - Must be unique within the project
  - Cannot be changed after creation
- **Alias**: 
  - Must be unique per environment
  - Same alias can be used in different environments

  - Certificate is deployed to all specified environments
- **Automatic Deployment**: 
  - Certificate is automatically deployed after creation
  - Deployment results are returned in the response
  - Failed deployments are included in `environmentResults`
- **Certificate Validation**:

  - Invalid certificates will cause creation to fail
- **Permissions**: 
  - Requires `ROLE_MANAGE_PROXIES` permission
