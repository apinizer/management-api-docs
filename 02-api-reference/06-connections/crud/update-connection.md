```

## Authentication

Requires a Personal API Access Token.

### Header

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Request

### Headers

| Header | Value | Required |
|--------|-------|----------|

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| projectName | string | Yes | Project name |
| connectionName | string | Yes | Connection name (must exist) |

### Request Body

#### Full JSON Body Example (Email Connection)

```json
{
  "type": "email",
  "name": "my-email-connection",
  "description": "Updated email connection description",
  "deployToWorker": true,
  "enabled": true,
  "host": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "port": 587,
  "enableStartTls": true,
  "auth": true,
  "username": "updated-user@example.com",
  "password": "new-app-password",
  "defaultEncoding": "UTF-8",
  "from": "noreply@example.com",
  "additionalProperties": []
}
```

#### Request Body Fields

The request body structure is identical to [Create Connection](/management-api-docs/02-api-reference/06-connections/crud/create-connection/). See that documentation for complete field descriptions.

**Important:** Connection name in path parameter must match the existing connection name.

##### Common Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| type | string | Yes | - | Connection type discriminator field. Must match the existing connection type. Used to identify the connection type in API requests/responses. |
| name | string | Yes | - | Connection name (must match path parameter, or new name if renaming) |
| description | string | No | - | Connection description |
| deployToWorker | boolean | No | true | Whether to deploy to worker |
| enabled | boolean | No | true | Whether connection is enabled |

**Note:** Connection-specific fields vary by connection type. See individual connection type documentation for details.

## Response

### Success Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "deploymentResult": {
    "success": true
  }
}
```

#### Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| success | boolean | Indicates if the request was successful |
| deploymentResult | object | Deployment result (if deployToWorker=true) |
| deploymentResult.success | boolean | Deployment success |

### Error Response (400 Bad Request)

```json
{
  "error": "bad_request",
  "error_description": "Connection (name: my-email-connection) was not found!"
}
```

### Common Causes

- Connection name does not exist
- Connection name in path does not match name in body (unless renaming)
- New connection name conflicts with existing connection
- Invalid connection type (cannot change connection type)
- Missing required fields for connection type
- Invalid field values

### Error Response (401 Unauthorized)

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized_client",
  "error_description": "Invalid token"
}
```

### Error Response (404 Not Found)

```json
{
  "error": "not_found",
  "error_description": "Project 'MyProject' not found"
}
```

## cURL Example

### Example 1: Update Connection Configuration

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/connections/my-email-connection/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "email",
    "name": "my-email-connection",
    "description": "Updated email connection",
    "deployToWorker": true,
    "enabled": true,
    "host": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "port": 587,
    "enableStartTls": true,
    "auth": true,
    "username": "updated-user@example.com",
    "password": "new-app-password",
    "defaultEncoding": "UTF-8",
    "from": "noreply@example.com"
  }'
```

### Example 2: Rename Connection

Rename a connection by providing a new name in the body (path parameter keeps old name).

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/connections/old-connection-name/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "email",
    "name": "new-connection-name",
    "description": "Renamed connection",
    "deployToWorker": true,
    "enabled": true,
    "host": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "port": 587,
    "auth": true,
    "username": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password"
  }'
```

**Note:** The new name must not conflict with existing connections.

### Example 3: Update and Disable

Update connection configuration and disable it.

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/connections/my-db-connection/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "database",
    "name": "my-db-connection",
    "description": "Updated database connection - disabled",
    "deployToWorker": true,
    "enabled": false,
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "databaseName": "mydb",
    "username": "dbuser",
    "password": "dbpassword"
  }'
```

## Notes and Warnings

- **Name Matching**: Connection name in path parameter must match the existing connection name (or new name if renaming)
- **Type Cannot Change**: Connection type (`type`) cannot be changed. Use Delete and Create to change type.
- **Name Conflicts**: If renaming, ensure the new name doesn't conflict with existing connections
- **Secret Fields**: Secret fields can be updated. Ensure you have the correct values.
- **Deployment**: If `deployToWorker: true`, connection is automatically redeployed to workers
- **References**: References to certificates or keystores can be updated by providing new names
