## Notes and Warnings

- **Permanent Deletion**: Connection deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- **Dependencies**: Ensure no policies or other components are using the connection before deletion
- **Case Sensitivity**: Connection names are case-insensitive
- **Deployment**: Connection is automatically removed from workers if it was deployed
- **References**: If other connections reference this connection, those references may break
