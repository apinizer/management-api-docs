# Delete Policy

## Overview

Deletes an existing policy from an API Proxy. The policy can be deleted from the request, response, or error pipeline, and can be deleted from all endpoints or a specific endpoint.

## Endpoint

```
DELETE /apiops/projects/{projectName}/apiProxies/{apiProxyName}/policies/{policyName}/
```

## Authentication

Requires a Personal API Access Token.

### Header

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

```

#### Request Body Fields

##### operationMetadata

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| targetScope | string | Yes | - | Policy scope: `ALL` or `ENDPOINT` |
| targetEndpoint | string | No* | - | Endpoint path (required if targetScope=ENDPOINT) |

**Note:** The `order` field is not used for delete operations.

### EnumPolicyTargetScope

- `ALL` - Delete policy from all endpoints
- `ENDPOINT` - Delete policy only from specified endpoint

### EnumPolicyTargetPipeline

- `REQUEST` - Delete from request pipeline
- `RESPONSE` - Delete from response pipeline
- `ERROR` - Delete from error pipeline

### EnumHttpRequestMethod

- `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, `TRACE`, `ALL`

**Note:** When `targetScope` is `ENDPOINT`, both `targetEndpoint` and `targetEndpointHTTPMethod` are required.

## Response

### Success Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS"
}
```

If `deploy: true` is set in the request, the response includes deployment result:

```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "deploymentResult": {
    "success": true,
    "responseTime": 1500,
    "detailList": [
      {
        "envName": "production",
        "podName": "pod-123",
        "podIp": "10.0.0.1",
        "success": true,
        "responseTime": 1500
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| status | string | Response status: `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE` |
| deploymentResult | object | Deployment result (if deploy=true). See [Deployment Result Object](#deployment-result-object) |

### Deployment Result Object (deploymentResult)


| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| success | boolean | Overall deployment success status |
| responseTime | integer | Total deployment response time in milliseconds |
| detailList | array | List of deployment details per pod/environment |

### Deployment Detail Object (detailList item)


| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| envName | string | Environment name |
| podName | string | Pod name where deployment occurred |
| podIp | string | Pod IP address |
| success | boolean | Deployment success status for this pod |
| responseTime | integer | Deployment response time for this pod in milliseconds |

### EnumStatus

- `SUCCESS` - Operation successful
- `FAILURE` - Operation failed

### Error Response (400 Bad Request)

```json
{
  "error": "bad_request",
  "error_description": "A policy with name (my-policy) does not exist in API Proxy!"
}
```

### Common Causes

- Policy name does not exist
- Invalid targetScope (ENDPOINT without targetEndpoint)
- Invalid targetEndpoint (endpoint not found in API Proxy)
- Policy not found in specified pipeline/scope

### Error Response (401 Unauthorized)

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized_client",
  "error_description": "Invalid token"
}
```

### Error Response (404 Not Found)

```json
{
  "error": "not_found",
  "error_description": "ApiProxy (name: MyAPI) was not found!"
}
```

## cURL Example

### Example 1: Delete Policy from All Endpoints

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/apiProxies/MyAPI/policies/throttling-policy/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operationMetadata": {
      "targetScope": "ALL",
      "targetPipeline": "REQUEST",
      "deploy": true,
      "deployTargetEnvironmentNameList": ["production"]
    }
  }'
```

### Example 2: Delete Policy from Specific Endpoint

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/apiProxies/MyAPI/policies/endpoint-throttling/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operationMetadata": {
      "targetScope": "ENDPOINT",
      "targetEndpoint": "/api/users",
      "targetEndpointHTTPMethod": "GET",
      "targetPipeline": "REQUEST",
      "deploy": false
    }
  }'
```

### Example 3: Delete Policy Without Deployment

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/apiProxies/MyAPI/policies/test-policy/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operationMetadata": {
      "targetScope": "ALL",
      "targetPipeline": "REQUEST",
      "deploy": false
    }
  }'
```

### Example 4: Delete Policy from Response Pipeline

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/apiProxies/MyAPI/policies/response-logging/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operationMetadata": {
      "targetScope": "ALL",
      "targetPipeline": "RESPONSE",
      "deploy": true,
      "deployTargetEnvironmentNameList": ["production"]
    }
  }'
```

## Notes and Warnings

- **Policy Name**: Policy name is case-insensitive. The policy is found by case-insensitive name matching.
- **Scope**: If policy exists in multiple scopes (ALL and ENDPOINT), you must delete from each scope separately.
- **Pipeline**: If policy exists in multiple pipelines (REQUEST, RESPONSE, ERROR), you must delete from each pipeline separately.
- **Deployment**: If `deploy: true`, ensure environments exist and user has deployment permissions.
- **Multiple Instances**: If a policy with the same name exists in multiple positions (e.g., order 1 and order 3), all instances are deleted.
- **Irreversible**: Policy deletion is permanent. Ensure you have a backup if needed.
