# Delete Endpoints from RLCL

## Overview

Removes specific endpoints from an RLCL. Only the specified endpoints are removed; other endpoints remain in the RLCL.

## Endpoint

```
DELETE /apiops/projects/{projectName}/rlcl/{rlclName}/endpoints/
```

## Authentication

Requires a Personal API Access Token.

### Header

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Request

Same structure as Add Endpoints. See [Add Endpoints](./add-endpoints) for field descriptions.

### Important Notes

- Only the specified endpoints are removed
- Endpoints not in the RLCL are ignored (no error)
- Match is based on `apiProxyName`, `endpointName`, and `endpointHTTPMethod`
- `endpointId` is automatically resolved from `endpointName` and `endpointHTTPMethod` (not sent in request)

### Response

Same as Add Endpoints. See [Add Endpoints](./add-endpoints) for response format.

## cURL Example

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/rlcl/PremiumUserRLCL/endpoints/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "endpointRateLimitList": [
      {
        "apiProxyName": "MyAPI",
        "endpointName": "/users",
        "endpointHTTPMethod": "GET"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Notes and Warnings

- **Selective Removal**: 
  - Only the specified endpoints are removed
  - Other endpoints remain in the RLCL
- **Match Criteria**: 
  - Endpoints are matched by `apiProxyName`, `endpointName`, and `endpointHTTPMethod`
  - `endpointId` is automatically resolved from `endpointName` and `endpointHTTPMethod` (not sent in request)
