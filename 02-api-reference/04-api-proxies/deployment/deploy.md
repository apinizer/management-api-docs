## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Deploy to Single Environment

Deploy an API proxy to a single environment.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/apiProxies/petstore-api/environments/production/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Scenario 2: Deploy to Multiple Environments

To deploy to multiple environments, make separate POST requests for each environment.

```bash
# Deploy to production
curl -X POST \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/apiProxies/petstore-api/environments/production/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Deploy to staging
curl -X POST \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/apiProxies/petstore-api/environments/staging/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Notes and Warnings

- **API Proxy Must Exist**: The API proxy must exist before deployment
- **Environment Access**: User must have access to the target environment
- **Permissions**: Requires both `ROLE_MANAGE_PROXIES` and `ROLE_DEPLOY_UNDEPLOY_PROXIES` permissions

- **Redeployment**: If the API proxy is already deployed, this operation redeploys it
- **Deployment History**: Deployment history is automatically recorded
