## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Undeploy from Single Environment

Undeploy an API proxy from a single environment.

```bash
curl -X DELETE \

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Scenario 2: Undeploy from Multiple Environments

To undeploy from multiple environments, make separate DELETE requests for each environment.

curl -X DELETE \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/apiProxies/petstore-api/environments/production/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Undeploy from staging
curl -X DELETE \
  "https://demo.apinizer.com/apiops/projects/MyProject/apiProxies/petstore-api/environments/staging/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```
